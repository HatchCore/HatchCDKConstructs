# HatchCDKConstructs
This project was generated by the Hatch CLI.

This package contains reusable CDK constructs to be used in other packages. Because this package  uses its own CDK constructs to deploy itself, it must be first manually CDK deployed and then pushed to the main branch if logical changes are made.

## Development
```
git clone https://github.com/HatchCore/HatchCDKConstructs.git
cd HatchCDKConstructs

# Create virtual environment and install all dependencies into it.
python3 -m venv .env && source .env/bin/activate
pip install .

# TODO: Add new reusable CDK constructs to be used across various hatch packages.

# TODO: Submit PR

cdk deploy --profile <aws_profile_for_account>

# TODO: Merge and push to the `main` branch
```

### Getting Started
Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies from other projects.
* `python3 -m venv .env && source .env/bin/activate`

Install all python dependencies into virtual environment
* `pip install .`

### Testing
This package is configured to run pytest. All unit tests should live under the `test/` directory and be prefixed with
`test_`.
Run tests with:
* `python setup.py test`
